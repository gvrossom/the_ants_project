# Repository for the ants project

Contains description, business plan, business canvas, documentation, ...

## Structure of the repo

- Current: two files containing the high level stuctures with few details.

- Future: refactor to two diferent folders (?)

## Contribute

### Github workflow

The best resource for that is the [github documentation](https://help.github.com) itsef

Grosso modo the process looks like this:

- forking the repo
- create local copy on your computer
- write some text
- commit your local change to your remote fork
- make a pull request to this project (depends on your status)

### Porter 5 forces

Competitive rivalry includes:

 - Crowdfundings, hedge funds

Threat of new entry is moderate:

	Behind the scene, we must integrate the knowledge on funding strategies.
	Following the open source community's mind, we may even say that we embrace new entry? Could we even create and sell the structure for attacking the finance market?

Supplier power:

	We may require:

	- Attorney service
	- Consultancy

Threat of substitution is relatively low:

	we are not yet another crowdfunding platform, we are closer to the MyMicroInvest mind.
	The user is still a click away from our product.

	Product/Service based on knowledge.
	We have a societal bond.

Buyer power

- Many customers on one side (private investors)
- Few on the other side (private projectors)
